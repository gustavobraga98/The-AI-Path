# Variables and Data Types

## Core Concepts:
1. Java is case sensitive.
That means that letter case matters. (A differs from a)
2. Semi-colon means end of statement.
3. String Variables: Is a variable that can hold anything that's made up of characters.
4. Characters: Is a single Alphabetical letter, digit or even a symbol.

## Summary of commands:
* System.out.println(); — Prints somethin in a newline
    * Example: System.out.println("Hello World") Prints on the screen "Hello World"
* int variable_name; — Creates a integer variable.
* variable(string).length(); Returns the count of the characters of a string.
* variable(string).toUpperCase();) Transforms the string in an all Uppercase sentence.
