# Variables and Data Types

## Core Concepts:
1. Java is case sensitive.
That means that letter case matters. (A differs from a)
2. Semi-colon means end of statement.

## Summary of commands:
* System.out.println(); â€” Prints somethin in a newline
    * Example: System.out.println("Hello World") Prints on the screen "Hello World"
