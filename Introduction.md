This section is meant to be an resumee of the entire wiki:

# Starters Kit:
For now I will recommend only one book and explain its use:
1. [Reinforcement Learning: An introduction.](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf) â€”
by Sutton and Barto

After that you need a strong base on Java and JavaScript, therefore I suggest you to take this two courses:
1. [Java Programming Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282)
2. [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283)

Along the courses you will have a bunch of questions that will pop up in your head, i strongly suggest you to grab this book and search for the subject in matter. The less doubt you have about a term or concept the less probable that you will back out of the classes.

With the materials in hand you should take your first course:
2. [Practical Reinforcement Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl) from Coursera

On the left menu or down here on table of content you should find a new tab where I will compile <b>MINE</b> notes about the course. You can use this to help you in your path to Learn RL.
