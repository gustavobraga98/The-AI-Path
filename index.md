# Welcome to The AI Path!

### What's for?
This page is meant to document and organize my studies on the Artificial Inteligence field. Primarly to serve as an review source for my studies but hopefully to help someone else explore this technology too.

### First Things First:
I am starting my progress using this medium article:
[Newbieâ€™s Guide to Study Reinforcement Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/newbies-guide-to-study-reinforcement-learning-8b9002eff643)

Probably the next sections will be about all the content that Arkar Min Aung cites on that post. I hope to complete each one of them.
